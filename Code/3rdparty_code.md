# State third party source code in your submission:

##### All code in this folder is ours _except_ some code in the Unity folder:
All code inside the Unity folder is third party _except_ the scripts inside Unity\DAVE\Assets\Scripts. 
However, some code in _JsonParser.cs_ (located in \Unity\DAVE\Assets\Scripts\DiagramDistributor) were initially auto generated based on the JSON structure we were provided with. The code was later modified to be more compact and less redundant but initially originates from auto-generated code from https://app.quicktype.io/#l=cs&r=json2csharp.
